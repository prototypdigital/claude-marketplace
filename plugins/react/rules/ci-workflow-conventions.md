# CI workflow conventions

Mutable action tags and broad permissions let a compromised upstream action or leaked token run arbitrary code with your repo's credentials. SHA pinning and minimal permissions are non-negotiable invariants — enforce them with a CI lint step (e.g. `zizmor` or a `pinned-actions` check) so prose alone is never the only guard.

## Action and tool pinning

- Pin third-party GitHub Actions to a commit SHA, never a branch or tag: `uses: actions/checkout@a81bbbf8298c0fa03ea29cdc473d45769f953675` not `@v4`.
- Use `action-versions` tools to automate SHA pinning and updates.
- For self-hosted tools, pin to specific versions in lockfiles or checksums.
- Document why each action is used and when its version was last reviewed.

## Permissions and OIDC

- Declare minimal `permissions:` at workflow level; override at job level if needed.
- Example: a test job needs no permissions; a deploy job needs `contents: read`, `id-token: write`.
- Never use long-lived PATs or secrets as CI credentials; prefer OIDC tokens (`id-token: write`, `permissions: id-token: write`).
- Rotate deploy keys and service account credentials after every successful deploy.

## Secrets and environment

- Store secrets in the repository's Secrets settings; never commit `.env` files.
- Reference secrets as `${{ secrets.SECRET_NAME }}` in workflows; never log them.
- Use `||` to set defaults for optional variables, never hardcode values.
- Document which secrets each job requires; make it part of onboarding.

## Concurrency and retries

- Use `concurrency:` groups to prevent overlapping deploy jobs: `group: deploy-${{ github.ref }}`, `cancel-in-progress: true`.
- Limit job `timeout-minutes:` to prevent hanging; default to 30 minutes for tests, 10 for deploys.
- Use conditional job triggers: `if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'` for deploy steps.
- Retry flaky steps with `continue-on-error:` sparingly; fix the root cause instead.

## Logging and debugging

- Never log secrets; mask them with `::add-mask::`.
- Use `runner.debug` and `secrets.ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG` to enable verbose output.
- Keep workflow logs concise; compress build artifacts to avoid storage costs.
- Archive test results and coverage reports for trend analysis.

## Examples

```yaml
# BAD — action pinned to a mutable tag; broad permissions; PAT in secret
permissions: write-all
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v4
  - run: deploy.sh
    env:
      TOKEN: ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_PAT }}

# GOOD — action pinned to SHA; minimal permissions; OIDC token
permissions:
  contents: read
  id-token: write
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@11bd71901bbe5b1630ceea73d27597364c9af683  # v4.2.2
  - uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@e3dd6a429d7300a6a4c196c26e071d42e0343502
    with:
      role-to-assume: ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_ROLE_ARN }}
      aws-region: eu-west-1
```
